# This help requires good knowledge about javascript; I did my best to clear up any doubts.

Emojis are included in the help; customized emojis are also supported. To get them just select the emoji and put a start
Ex: :customemoji: --------> :customemoji:
You should receive this: <:customemoji:EMOJI ID>

Open a ticket on github if you have problems!

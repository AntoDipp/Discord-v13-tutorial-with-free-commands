# Okay, letâ€™s get started!

First, all the code was created for users on repl.it so be careful about the files. env (visual studio users can change .env values in a config.json file)

## Create a file called index.js

It is the main file of our bot and without it cannot work!

Now open index.js in the files above and copy everything I wrote paying attention to the notes!

Then write in the console node index.js and now your bot will be online!

If everything worked, go to the next tutorial!
If you have problems, open a request here on github!
